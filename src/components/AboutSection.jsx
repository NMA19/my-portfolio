              <p>
                I'm a highly motivated Frontend Developer with over 3 years of hands-on experience 
                in designing and developing dynamic, user-centric web applications. Currently pursuing 
                my Master's in Networks and Distributed Systems while working full-time at LogikaBox.
              </p>
              <p>
                Specialized in modern technologies such as React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, 
                with a strong foundation in information systems and network engineering. I'm passionate 
                about continuous improvement, clean UI/UX design, and building scalable digital solutions 
                that drive business growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring machine learning, video editing, 
                cooking, or diving deep into UI/UX design principles. I believe in mentoring others 
                and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
